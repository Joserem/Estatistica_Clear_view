## About this Project 

A web application with interactive data visualization based on information contained in an excel file

## Functionalities

- The user can interact with the system by uploading a file and choosing the view desired.
- The code uses descriptive statistics integrated with data visualizations
- Code also offers additional functionality such as coloring expense bars based on value ranges and the inclusion of a range slider to filter data by date. This enriches the experience of
user when exploring the data.
- The user will be able to see their sales and revenues, expenses and customer satisfaction.

## Why?

This project is a significant part of my personal portfolio and was also developed as part of an academic work. 
The challenge was to create software that would have to contain data visualization (descriptive statistics).

## Some observations about this App

- Dummy data in the excel file was used to test the software. Test with other files and make changes as necessary
